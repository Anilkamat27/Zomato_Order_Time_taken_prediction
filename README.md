 A Zomato time prediction model! ðŸš€ Learned how to build an end-to-end ML project - from data ingestion, data transformation, model training, to creating a seamless training & prediction pipeline and integrated with a Flask web application. While the accuracy was not as good, I'm continuously learning more advanced ML algorithms to enhance prediction further. Looking forward to applying improved models on larger datasets for even better results in the future!
